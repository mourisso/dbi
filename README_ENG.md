Press **(A)** to open the folder and **(B)** to return. After opening the folder containing your installation files use the **(X)** button to select single or multiple files for installation. The **(Y)** button inverts your selections and the color of the name of the selected files will change from white to light blue.

Press the **(A)** button to confirm. A window with installation options will appear:

![2021041011441100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18294541/114264183-18138580-99f2-11eb-8c7b-536b4b831195.jpg)

*DBI will automatically and immediately remove old updates when installing a new update for a game, so you don't have to worry about the extra space they occupy.*

You can also navigate to your homebrew files and launch .nro files directly by highlighting them and pressing **(A)**.

### Install title from DBIbackend

If you cannot use DBI's MTP responder this is another convenient method for installing titles over USB. Installing over USB allows you to transfer files directly from your PC for example, which avoids the inconvenience and of having to first move the file to your SD card and then install it.

*Main menu hotkey for this option*: **(Y)** button

In order to use this option you will first require dbibackend (`dbibackend.exe` for Windows, or the `dbibackend` script for all operating systems). Launch dbibackend, select the files to install, select Start server, connect a USB-C cable from your PC to your Switch and select **Install title from DBIbackend** in DBI.

For proper operation of dbibackend on Windows, you need to install the "**libusbK (v3.1.0.0)**" drivers. They can be installed through the [Zadig program](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) by entering DBI into the "**Install title from DBIbackend**" mode and selecting the device that appears in the program.

From here you can select and install your files on the Switch in the same fashion as using Browse SD Card/Browse USB0 Drive.

To quickly send files or folders with games for installation, right-click on them, select `Send from dbibackend` and the installation files will be immediately placed in dbibackend's queue. To configure this in Windows, press `Win + R`, enter `shell: sendto` and create a shortcut for `dbibackend.exe` in the folder.

There are alternative clients for working with DBIbackend, for example [headless implementation](https://github.com/cyb3rwarden/dbibackend/blob/0885ef67edf28cbca30fb2c193ad7ab9a62786f7/dbibackend/dbibackend.py), [NSW-DBI 2.0.0 on nodegui](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=939714&st=6080#entry100701109) (requires installation of libusb driver for Linux or WinUSB (libusb) for Windows via Zadig).

You can pass commands to the script by running it from the command line and then specifying the path to the game or games you need to install. For example:

```
python ~/dbi/dbibackend ~/Switch/File1.nsp ~/Switch/File2.nsp ~/Switch/File3.nsp
```

```
dbibackend.exe "e:\Switch\Games\File1.nsp" "e:\Switch\Games\File2.nsp" "e:\Switch\Games\File3.nsp"
```

#### Dependencies that may be required to run on MacOS or Linux

```bash
brew install python-tk
pip3 install pyusb
```

### Home server

The **"Home server"** option will appear if the **Network install sources** section has been configured in **[dbi.config](#dbiconfig)**. You can specify the name of the option as required in the configuration file.

To install games over your network, edit the dbi.config file located in the `sdmc:/switch/DBI/` folder as required. For example:

```
; Network install sources
[Network sources]
; <display name>=<type>|<URL>
Home server=ApacheHTTP|http://192.168.1.47/Nintendo/Switch/
```

Install any HTTP server with DirectoryListing enabled on your PC: Apache, Mongoose, Python SimpleHTTP, sheret, rclone, etc.

Example for nginx on Windows:
Edit the file `/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`, registering the address of your Switch in `location`, instead of the `127.0.0.1` specified in the example (or your entire subnet like 192.168.1.1/24 or 192.168.0.0/16); it can be found on Switch in **System Preferences** > **Internet**:

```
location / {
root html;
index index.html index.htm;
}
location /Nintendo/Switch/ {
allow 127.0.0.1;
deny all;
autoindex on;
}
```

Save the config, run `nginx.exe`, allow the program to access the network, then copy the desired game to the local `/nginx/html/Nintendo/Switch/` folder on your PC, and on the Switch select “Home server”.
You will now be presented with the usual interface for installing files and you can start installing files over the network. You can stop the web server via nginx -s stop.

For the server address in `dbi.config`, you can also use a domain name, for example, your remote VPS - suggested to use with HTTP Basic authentication e.g.: `http://user:password@host:port/Nintendo/Switch/`

For example:
```
ApacheHTTP|Network repo|http://127.0.0.1/Nintendo/Switch/
ApacheHTTP|WWW VPS repo|http://www.myveryownswitchvpsdomain.su/Nintendo/Switch/
```

Generate the htpasswd file, put it in /nginx/conf/, then adjust the nginx.conf file as follows:

```
        location /Nintendo/Switch/ {
			   satisfy all;
			   allow 127.0.0.1;
			   deny all;
			   auth_basic "Password Protected Area";
			   auth_basic_user_file htpasswd; 
               autoindex on;
        }
```

Login "switch", password "pwd":

htpasswd-file:
```
switch:{SHA}N/omUzCtg+qoee+x4ttjgIls9jk=
```

### Browse installed applications

In **Browse installed applications** you can see a list of installed programs, updates and DLC with their occupied space, version (display version and hex version), their titleID, the total game time and the number of launches and the presence of installed LayeredFS mods for the game (for Atmosphére). 

*Main menu hotkey for this option*: **(L)** button

At the top center, the total number of installed games and the sorting type is displayed.

![2021062719353200](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18294541/123554546-32efcd80-d789-11eb-8d3f-3124448624e0.jpg)

On the left hand side in square brackets, information on the game installation location, installed file type and the presence of LayeredFS mods or cheats is denoted:

* **N/S/M/G** - NAND/SD/Mixed/Gamecart - Location of installed files, Mixed denotes that installed files were detected on both NAND and SD card
* **b** - BASE - the base game
* **u** - Update - update installed
* **d** - DLC - DLC installed
* **l** - LayeredFS mod - LayeredFS mods or cheats for the game were detected at `sdmc:/atmosphere/contents/%titleID%/`

You can quick launch a game directly from the list by highlighting it and pressing **(L3)**.

**Please note!** If the game is **highlighted in red** only an update and/or DLC is installed, the game itself is NOT installed.

#### Title context menu

![2021062719354100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18294541/123554557-3b480880-d789-11eb-9235-d547f2c588bd.jpg)

Displayed by clicking on **(+)** on the selected title(s).

* **Delete title** - delete selected titles
* **Move title to SD/NAND** - move the selected titles to SD card or NAND, depending on where the title is currently located. If content is installed to both locations then both options will be displayed
* **Reset required version** - resets the system version check required to run the title (debug must be enabled in Atmosphere)
* **Check integrity** - checks the data integrity of the selected titles
* **Expose contents via MTP** - mount the content of the selected titles via MTP 
* **Dump to SD** - dump all available content (game, DLC, update) to a SD card using the path specified in the config (default is `switch/DBI/dumps`)
* **Content info** - display additional information about the content (SDK version, required key generation, ID, patch information, and more)

If you press the **(A)** button on the title, the **detailed game menu** will open.

### Detailed game menu

The **detailed game menu** opens when you press the **(A)** button on a title while in the menu for browsing installed games (**Browse installed applications**)

![2021062719353600](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18294541/123554561-400cbc80-d789-11eb-8d81-e3403f33b365.jpg)

The game's icon, TitleID, name, author, version, supported languages, and the presence of an LFS mod are displayed in the detailed game menu, which can be accessed by pressing the **(A)** button on the game's tile while in the browse installed applications menu.

Additionally, the menu displays the total playtime, total launches, total occupied space, space in NAND and on SD, total saves size, and the game's forced language.

Below that, there are three tabs that can be switched between using the **(L)** and **(R)** buttons:

* **Content records**
* **Tickets**
* **Saves**

#### Content records

The information is displayed in the following format:

[Location] Type | version [version number] | Size

**Location** - **NAND** or **SD**, depending on where the content is installed
**Type** - **Application** for the base game, **Update** for updates, **Addon** for DLC, and the number of the DLC will be indicated next to it
**version [version number]** - the content version in dec and [hex] (for example, 786432 is 0.12.0.0)
**Size** - occupied space

By pressing the **(A)** button on the content, you can view its contents. The content can be copied by selecting the corresponding item in the context menu (which opens by pressing the **(+)** button). The content opens in "read-only" mode.

When you press the (+) button on the selected content, you can access the context menu, which includes:

* **Delete record** - delete the selected record
* **Move records to SD/NAND** - move the selected record to NAND or the memory card, depending on where it is currently located. If parts of the title are located in both places, both options will be displayed.
* **Reset required version** - reset the required system version check for launching the title (debug must be enabled in Atmosphere). This will not help if the game was built on a new SDK version.
* **Force language** - allows you to forcibly launch the game with a selected language. By default, the game runs with the same language selected in the system, if it is not available in the game, depending on the console region. The selected language will be displayed next to the game icon in the **Forced Language** field.
* **Check integrity** - checks the integrity of the selected title data.
* **Expose contents via MTP** - mounts the content of the selected titles via MTP.
* **Dump to SD** - dumps all available content (game, DLC, update) to the SD card according to the path specified in the config (default: switch/DBI/dumps).
* **Content info** - displays additional information about the content, including the SDK version, required key generation, ID, patch information, and much more.

#### Tickets

A **ticket (or encrypted title key)** is a unique encrypted information about the rights to launch game content that is installed in the system during the installation of each game (ending in **000** in the titleID)/update (ending in **800** in the titleID)/DLC.

Installed tickets for content are displayed, including:

* **Personalized ticket** - a ticket given when installing a game from the eShop, which is personalized and unique for each account.
* **Common ticket** - a general ticket that exists for updates and is also used as a workaround in pirated games.

The game databases on Nintendo servers are encrypted with the same key, but this key is encrypted with its own unique key for each game purchaser (generated on the console). Therefore, the key for decrypting the game can only be obtained from the personalized ticket on the console for which it was created. Thus, while personalized tickets differ for each purchaser, they all contain the same decryption key. Common tickets do not have encryption, only a signature.

By clicking the **(+)** button on the selected content, you can access a context menu where you can delete selected tickets. 

In some cases, if a specific error occurs and you are sure of what you are doing, you can delete it for a specific game and its updates/DLC. However, it is generally better to leave the tickets alone to avoid errors when launching games.

#### Saves

Viewing and deleting saves. If there is no save, it can be created through the context menu (button (+)) for the selected account. If there is a save:

* **Backup** - make a backup of the save. By default, it will be located in the `switch/DBI/saves` folder.
* **Restore** - restore the backup of the save.
* **Save info...** - detailed information about the save, such as type, size, account name, etc.
* **Increase save size** - increases the space allocated for the save by a specified value.
* **Delete** - delete the save.

### Browse tickets
View and delete game tickets. **Ticket (or encrypted title key)** is a special encrypted unique information about the rights to launch the content of the game, which is installed in the system during the installation of each game (**000** at the end of the titleID) / update (**800** at the end of titleID) / of each DLC.

* **+** means there is an installed game
* **[c]** (**Personalized ticket**) - a ticket that is given when installing a game from the eShop, it is personalized, meaning it is encrypted with a unique key from your console.
* **[p]** (**Common ticket**) - a common type of ticket that is used for updates and also used as a workaround for pirated games.

Game databases on Nintendo servers are encrypted with the same key, but this key is encrypted with a unique key for each purchased game (this key is generated on the console itself), so it is only possible to obtain the decryption key for a game from a Personalized ticket on the console it was created for.
This means that all Personalized tickets purchased are different, but they contain the same decryption key for the game.
Common tickets, on the other hand, do not have encryption, only a signature.

Sometimes if a specific error occurs and you know exactly what you are doing, it can be removed from a specific game and its update/DLC.

In most cases it is better not to touch anything here, in order to avoid errors when starting games.

#### Tickets context menu

Displayed by clicking on **(+)** on selected tickets

The number of selected tickets is displayed at the top of the context window.

* **Delete tickets** - delete selected tickets

* **Select same game** - highlight all tickets related to the selected game

### Tools

* **Cleanup orphaned files** - cleaning up lost files. Automatically cleans up unnecessary game files, files from interrupted/failed game installations, officially downloaded firmware updates and all unused game tickets if found.
* **Delete parental controls** - completely removes parental controls. No reboot required.
* **Delete user...** - completely removes the selected user from the system (the removed user's saves remain in the system).
* **Run random game** - launches a random game from those installed.
* **NTP time sync** - Synchronizes the console's time with a remote time synchronization server. Internet connection and correctly set timezone in the console settings are required for operation.
* **Check for title updates** - checks for updates and new DLC for installed games. The database for checking is set in the settings.

### Browse saves

View, backup and delete saves.

In general, saves are displayed in the following format:

`[Account] Game-Name Backup-date Size`

* **Account** - shows the name of the account for which the save was created, if the save type is Account, if the save type is other, it shows its type
* **Game-Name** - shows the name of the game for which the save was created
* **Backup-date** - shows the date when the backup was created, only displayed in the Backup tab
* **Size** - the size of the save or backup

Below, there are three tabs that can be switched using the **(L)** and **(R)** buttons:

* **Installed** - shows saves for all installed games
* **Uninstalled** - shows saves for all uninstalled games
* **Backups** - shows created backups

#### Context menu Installed and Uninstalled

* **Select same user** - select all saves belonging to a specific user.

If multiple backups are selected for one game and user in the list, only the most recent backup will be restored.

### Run MTP responder 

**Run MTP responder** activates the built-in MTP server in DBI for exchanging data with a PC or an Android device via USB-C OTG (phone/tablet/other devices). *Hotkey to call this option from the main menu*: the **(X)** button (also used to exit MTP). After connecting the USB cable to the PC and starting the MTP server in DBI, the following window will appear on the PC:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18294541/114265006-054f7f80-99f7-11eb-86c9-1a20d588e616.png)

1: **SD Card** - for viewing, copying and deleting files and folders from/to a PC and from/to your SD card. Drop a file larger than 4GB onto the SD card and DBI will automatically split the file into an archived folder which allows the Switch to see it as a single file, with this you can for example very easily add a >4GB .XCI for use in SX OS or add a >4GB movie for watching in NXMP or pPlay.

2: **NAND User** - view and copy files and folders to a PC from the Switch's internal memory USER partition (this partition is read-only).

3: **NAND System** - view and copy files and folders to a PC from the Switch's internal memory SYSTEM partition (the partition is read-only).

4: **Installed games** - all installed games are displayed from both NAND (internal memory of the Switch) and SD card. To dump installed games to your PC in NSP format, just copy the folder with the name of the game from Installed games to your PC. A common ticket with completely cleared personal information is generated based on your personalized ticket. Your dump will be in separate files - the game itself, the update and any DLC files. If cheats or mods have been installed for the game, they will be located in the `Mods & Cheats` folder. You can also dump a single combined multicontent file containing the game itself, the update and all DLC, these files are located at the root of the **Installed games** directory.

5: **SD install** - Drop or copy your **NSP**/**NSZ**/**XCI** or **XCZ** files in this folder. When the transfer is complete the game will be installed on the **SD card** of your console. When installing NSZ or XCZ files, keep in mind that their actual size may differ greatly from their original size after installation: so if for example you start with 2GB free on your SD card and you do not have enough space to install an NSZ of 1GB in size, that is because NSZ and XCZ files are compressed and must be decompressed for installation.

6: **NAND install** - Drop or copy your **NSP**/**NSZ**/**XCI** or **XCZ** files in this folder. When the transfer is complete the game will be installed on the **internal memory** of your console.

7: **Saves** - Access to all save types stored in the internal memory of the Switch: accounts **(Account)**, system programs **(System)**, Background Content Asymmetric synchronized delivery and Transmission (**BCAT**, for example: events in ACNH), temporary **(Temporary)**, cache (**Cache**, for example: addons in DOOM), system BCAT **(SystemBCAT)** and Device Saves **(Device)** 

Backup, restore and manage save data for both installed and uninstalled games. You can make a backup of them by copying them to a PC and also delete saves that you no longer want or need - to do this open the folder with the name of the game you need, then delete the required save folder.
In order to restore saves, copy them to the appropriate folder from your PC. DBI does not require pre-launching the game before restoring a save.

8: **Album** - direct access to official Album screenshots and videos per game/title, similar to the official feature added in OFW 11.0.0.

9: **Gamecard** - with a gamecard inserted into the Switch you can dump to .XCI or trimmed .XCI on the PC, along with the update built into it if present. The personal RSA certificate automatically removed and is dumped separately.

After activating the MTP server on the Switch a window will appear with your account nickname and its UID, as well as the number of game saves: 

![2021041013152900](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18294541/114266673-27013480-9a00-11eb-81ba-f1ff1c3c5abb.jpg)

#: **Custom Storage** - If you have defined a custom virtual MTP drive in the **[dbi.config](#dbiconfig)** file it will appear here.

To turn off the MTP server and exit to the main menu, press either the **(X)** or **(B)** button.

### Activity Log

Displays activity graphs in games by dates for all existing users for each specific game.

Upon launch, two tabs are shown, which can be switched between using the (L) and (R) buttons:

Hotkeys:
* (L)/(R) - switch to the neighboring tab
* (ZL)/(ZR) - change the date
* (Y) - change the display period: all time, day, month, year
* (X) - sorting: by game title, by number of launches, by time spent in the game
* (+) - select a user for display

#### Applications

A list of games for which there is launch statistics is shown. At the top of the window is a status line of the following type:

`[player] period. Total: number of hours (sorting method)`. For example, the line `[All players] 2023 January. Total: 72 hours (by play time)` means that the screen displays statistics **for all players for January 2023, sorted by game time, where 72 hours have been played**

The window is divided into three columns. From left to right:
  * Game title
  * Number of launches
  * Amount of time spent in the game

When you press (A) on a game, you enter the **Activity** for the current game, where statistics for the selected game are shown. When you press (A) on an item, you will go deeper (year -> month -> day -> hour)

#### Activity

Activity is shown as a diagram for all games at once. To go to the diagram for a specific game, go to the **Applications** tab and select a game to display.

## Warnings and errors
### Warnings

Displayed in orange. These are NOT errors!

* **[SIGNATURE: Invalid]**, **[SIGNATURE: XCI->NSP]**, **[HASH NOT MATCHED TO META]**, **[HASH FIXED IN META]** — these are NOT errors, but notifications of signature mismatch in headers, for example, when using conversion or editing, custom NSP, forwarder.
* **HASH MISMATCH** — most often, this is NOT an error, the game was converted from a cartridge (then everything is fine), sometimes there are problems with file integrity, re-download/re-hash it, data transfer via USB cable/port/during installation between PC and Switch.
If the game does not launch or launches with an error, try to reinstall it again, check or replace the USB cable/SD/change USB port.
* **[DELTA SKIPPED]** — this is NOT an error, but a notification that unnecessary fragments in the update file were skipped if they were in it, as it should have been.
* **No tickets found** — this is NOT an error, it does not affect the game's functionality, but informs that the game is without tickets. It may be a dump from a .XCI cartridge or converted to Standard Crypto.
* **Application uses AddonContent titleId**, **Application uses Update titleId** — this is NOT an error, usually indicating a homebrew game in .NSP, created not to standard, for example, when AddonContent flag (DLC) was added to the Application title (main game, v0).
If such a game launches and works, then everything is fine.
* **This application base is not stand alone. Make sure you installed update** - when installing new Sparse Storage games — this is NOT an error, do not forget, in addition to the game's base file, to also install an update to it before launching.

### ERRORs

* **USB communication failed** - check/replace USB cable and USB port on PC.
* **Cannot parse content meta**:
  * **Old firmware** - your firmware is too outdated to analyze the metafile. Update CFW and system software to the latest versions
  * **Unexpected error** - the file is corrupted. Check and re-download the file.
* **Invalid PFS0 magic!** - redownload the game installer file and check its integrity, as this file is corrupted.
* **[INVALID NCA MAGIC]** - update to the latest version of OFW and CFW, and if the error persists, double-check the integrity of the game installer file.
* **Installation aborted** - data transmission error, double-check and if necessary, replace the USB cable/USB port between the Switch and PC. Also, make sure that you have installed the latest version of the software, as in this post.
* **Nothing to install** - in the file selection window, rename the file without special characters, hieroglyphs, or Cyrillic in the name and path to it.
* **Transfer error**, **[TRANSFER CRC ERROR]**, **[TRANSFER ABORTED]** - check the USB-C cable connection and USB port, check with other USB-C cables, check the integrity of the game file and memory card for errors. When installing via MTP, launch dbi through any game (title) while holding down the (R) button, rather than in applet mode through albums.
* **Error occurred: Invalid argument** - update your dbi to the latest version.
* **SOME CONTENTS ARE MISSING. APPLICATION WILL BE UNUSABLE** - a corrupt file system on the memory card or a non-working/poor quality flash drive. Check it with chkdsk and h2testw; if there are no errors, reformat to FAT32.
* **[NOT ENOUGH SPACE]**, **[CAN NOT CREATE PLACEHOLDER]** - there is not enough space on the memory card/NAND, free up more space or check the memory card. Check it with chkdsk and h2testw; if there are no errors, reformat to FAT32.
* **Extra buffers exceeded. Media write speed is too low** - when installing via MTP, launch dbi through any game (title) while holding down the **(R)** button. Alternatively, use an NSP-forwarder and a faster SD card with a different USB cable/port.
* **No tickets found but they are required** - an incorrect (incomplete, without a ticket but with titlerights) game dump, find another.
* **Invalid personalized ticket** - This error occurs at the end of game installation when installing a .tik ticket, indicating that an incorrect game dump was used where a personalized ticket from the console on which the game was purchased was left instead of a common ticket. Please download another correct dump.
* **No ES sigpatches!** - This error message means that the ES sigpatches are either outdated, incorrect, or not installed on the console. Please install the latest version of the ES sigpatches.

## Other options

### Mounting the content of installed titles via MTP

Go to "**Browse installed applications**" -> Choose apps you need to mount with **(X)** -> Press **(+)** -> "**Expose contents via MTP**"

### Backup and Restore Saves via MTP

1. Connect your console in MTP mode via DBI.
1. Navigate to the **Saves** folder on your PC.
1. You can either copy your saves to your PC or restore them by simply dragging them into this folder.

### Using DBI to Install Mods

1. Connect to your computer via MTP mode in DBI
1. Go to **Installed Games**, in the folder with the name of your game
1. Go to **Mods & Cheats** folder
1. Place your mod in the **Mods & Cheats** folder
* **Be careful**, you need to ensure that you copy the contents of the titleID folder and not the titleID folder itself! For example, you downloaded a translation for the game Cadence of Hyrule, in the form of the archive `Cadence of Hyrule.rar`. Inside this archive you see a folder with the titleID of the game - `01000B900D8B0000`. You need to extract the archive, go to the folder `01000B900D8B0000` and copy the entire **contents** of the folder to **Mods & Cheats**! Not the folder `01000B900D8B0000` itself, but everything inside it! In this example (and in most cases), that would be the `romfs` folder

### USB 3.0 

DBI supports USB 3.0. If you are using kefir, then USB 3.0 is active by default. Otherwise, you need to activate this function by uncommenting and editing the Atmosphere system settings configuration file at `sdmc:/atmosphere/config/system_settings.ini` as follows:

```
[usb]
usb30_force_enabled = u8!0x1
```

**Important** - activating USB 3.0 can interfere with bluetooth and 2.4GHz wifi connections. If you experience any connection issues with your wireless controllers or 2.4GHz wifi networks then you should not activate USB 3.0. 5GHz wifi connections should be generally unaffacted.

### Restoring clean user saves from backup

These are decrypted saves that are located in the `USER:/saves` folder. In case the emunand is damaged, these saves can be retrieved through a PC or Tegra Explorer and restored through DBI.

You can place these saves in the backup saves folder of DBI (`/switch/dbi/saves` by default) and restore them through the standard save restoration menu (the user's name will be enclosed in curly brackets `{}` in this case), or through the context menu invoked on the file of such a save.

### Set picture as avatar

Hover over the desired picture and bring up the context menu with the (+) button. Select "**Set as avatar...**". The selected image will be set as your avatar. The image will be automatically resized to square proportions and scaled down to the necessary size. If you want the image to maintain its original aspect ratio, prepare it in advance.

### Editing and Viewing Files 

Any file can be opened as a text or as HEX. Non-empty files are opened in viewing mode, however, the (L3) key will switch to editing mode. Let's consider both modes separately. 

You can also create an empty text file from the context menu (called by the (+) button > **Create a new file...**). When opening an empty text file, the editor will start automatically.

#### File Viewing Mode 

**Hotkeys:** 
* **DPAD / Left Stick / Right Stick** - text scrolling 
* **(L) / (R) / (ZL) / (ZR)** - next / previous page (screen)
* **(R3)** - switch between text or HEX viewing modes
* **(L3)** - switch to editing mode
* **(+)** - context menu

**Context Menu:**
* **Editing** - switch to editing mode
* **Encoding** - change text encoding. Note that when changing the encoding in viewing mode, when the file is closed and reopened, the encoding will not change
* **Line Wrapping** - whether or not to wrap text to a new line when it reaches the edge of the screen

#### File Editing Mode 

You can edit text by moving around the keyboard with the right stick and selecting a letter with the (A) button.

**Hotkeys:** 
* **Right Stick** - move around the keyboard
* **DPAD / Left Stick** - move around the text
* **(A)** - select the highlighted character on the keyboard
* **(X)** - delete character (Backspace)
* **(B)** - file saving menu
* **(Y)** - space
* **(L)+(LEFT)** - Go to the beginning of the line (HOME)
* **(L)+(RIGHT)** - Go to the end of the line (END)
* **(R)+(LEFT)** - Go to the next word
* **(R)+(RIGHT)** - Go to the previous word
* **(ZL)** - change case 
* **(ZR)** - move to the next line (Enter)
* **(R3)** - switch language 
* **(L3)** - switch to viewing mode 

When closing a file or switching to viewing mode, you can choose whether or not to save changes if changes were made to the file.
